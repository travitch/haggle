-- | Depth-first search and derived operations.
--
-- All of the search variants take a list of 'Vertex' that serves as
-- roots for the search.
--
-- The [x] variants ('xdfsWith' and 'xdffWith') are the most general
-- and are fully configurable in direction and action.  They take a
-- \"direction\" function that tells the search what vertices are
-- next from the current 'Vertex'.  They also take a summarization function
-- to convert a 'Vertex' into some other value.  This could be 'id' or a
-- function to extract a label, if supported by your graph type.
--
-- The [r] variants are reverse searches, while the [u] variants are
-- undirected.
--
-- A depth-first forest is a collection (list) of depth-first trees.  A
-- depth-first tree is an n-ary tree rooted at a vertex that contains
-- the vertices reached in a depth-first search from that root.  The
-- edges in the tree are a subset of the edges in the graph.
