-- | Compute the dominators in a graph from a root node.
--
-- The set of dominators for a 'Vertex' in a graph is always with regard
-- to a @root@ 'Vertex', given as input to the algorithm.  'Vertex' @d@
-- dominates 'Vertex' @v@ if every path from the @root@ to @v@ must go
-- through @d@.  @d@ strictly dominates @v@ if @d@ dominates @v@ and is not
-- @v@.  The immediate dominator of @v@ is the unique 'Vertex' that strictly
-- dominates @v@ and does not strictly dominate any other 'Vertex' that
-- dominates @v@.
--
-- This implementation is ported from FGL (<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/fgl>)
-- and is substantially similar.  The major change is that it uses the vector
-- library instead of array.
--
-- The algorithm is based on \"A Simple, Fast Dominance Algorithm\" by
-- Cooper, Harvey, and Kennedy
--
-- <http://www.cs.rice.edu/~keith/EMBED/dom.pdf>
--
-- This is not Tarjan's algorithm; supposedly this is faster in practice
-- for most graphs.
